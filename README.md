## Q1: Identify missing or incorrect data in the dataset and apply appropriate preprocessing steps to clean it.
### Explanation:

Identify Missing Data: Use isnull() to find missing values in each column. This step helps understand where data imputation is necessary.
Handle Missing Values:
For numerical columns, fill missing values with the mean. This approach maintains the overall distribution and minimizes bias.
For categorical columns like sex, use the mode (most frequent value) to fill missing entries, ensuring no loss of information.
Identify Incorrect Data: Check for invalid entries (e.g., negative values for physical measurements). Remove rows with such entries to ensure data quality.
Code Example:


    df.isnull().sum()  # Identify missing values
    df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)  # Fill with mean for numerical
    df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mode()[0], inplace=True)  # Fill with mode for categorical
    df = df[df['column'] > 0]  # Remove negative values


Q2: What is the average body_mass_g for Gentoo penguins?
Explanation:

Filtering Data: To find the average body mass for Gentoo penguins, filter the DataFrame for rows where the species column is "Gentoo".
Calculating the Average: Use the mean() function to calculate the average of the body_mass_g column for the filtered rows.
Code Example:


    average_mass = df[df['species'] == 'Gentoo']['body_mass_g'].mean()
    print(f"Average body mass for Gentoo penguins: {average_mass}")


## Q3: How do the distributions of bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm differ between the three penguin species? Analyze the skewness and kurtosis of each feature for different species.

### Explanation:

Distribution Analysis: Use plots like box plots and violin plots to visualize how bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm differ among species.
Skewness and Kurtosis: Calculate these metrics for each feature grouped by species.
Skewness indicates the asymmetry of the distribution; a skewness near zero suggests a symmetric distribution.
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution; higher values indicate heavier tails.

    df.groupby('species')['bill_length_mm'].agg(['skew', 'kurt']).reset_index()


## Q4: Identify which features in the dataset have outliers. Provide the method used to detect them and visualize the outliers.

### Explanation:

Outlier Detection: Use methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify outliers:
Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile), and find the IQR (Q3 - Q1).
Define outliers as values below 

Visualization: Box plots are effective for visualizing outliers.


    Q1 = df['column'].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df['column'].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    outliers = df[(df['column'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df['column'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]


## Q5: Does this dataset contribute to the curse of dimensionality? If yes, perform PCA.

### Explanation:

Curse of Dimensionality: This phenomenon occurs when the feature space becomes sparse, making it difficult for algorithms to find patterns.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality while preserving variance. This process simplifies the dataset by transforming it into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables (principal components).


    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(df.select_dtypes(include=[float, int]))

## Q6: Use bill_length_mm vs bill_depth_mm and plot 7 different graphs to visualize them.

### Explanation:

Visualizations: Various plots can provide insights into the relationship between these two features:
Scatter plot, box plot, violin plot, joint plot, pair plot, histogram, and KDE plot.
Each plot serves a different purpose, like showing distribution (box/violin), relationships (scatter/joint), and frequency (histogram/KDE).


    sns.scatterplot(x='bill_length_mm', y='bill_depth_mm', hue='species', data=df)

## Q7: Find the maximum flipper_length_mm for each combination of species and island. Which species has the longest flippers on each island?

### Explanation:

Group By: Use groupby() to aggregate the maximum flipper_length_mm for each species and island combination.
Identification: After aggregation, identify which species has the longest flippers for each island.


    max_flippers = df.groupby(['species', 'island'])['flipper_length_mm'].max().reset_index()


## Q8: Perform z-score normalization on this dataset.

### Explanation:

Z-score Normalization: This technique standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It is calculated as 
Use Case: Normalization helps in algorithms sensitive to feature scales, such as k-means clustering or gradient descent.


    from scipy.stats import zscore
    df_normalized = df.copy()
    df_normalized[df.select_dtypes(include=[float, int]).columns] = df.select_dtypes(include=[float, int]).apply(zscore)
